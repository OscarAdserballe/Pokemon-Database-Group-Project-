				<p>For millennia, man has lived alongside Pokemon in peace and prosperity, hunting together in the warm summers and snuggling against each other during the freezing winters. While each person eventually finds their complementary Pokemon, based on size, colour, type, and abilities, the most important trait one considers while choosing their companion, cuteness, has never been objectified in any Pokemon card, game, database, or cartoon. To break this trend, we have developed several algorithms relating the creatures’ characteristics with an empirical measurement of their cuteness.

					<p>Samo Kobe is host of the controversial 'BulbaWars' podcast. After dropping out of high school to pursue his radio dreams, the 18-year-old never left the media spotlight due to his daring and often outspoken content creation. His 2018 documentary 'Inside the Charmander’s cave', depicting the everyday struggles of fire-type Pokemon in world of more refrigerators, received 2 Oscar nominations as well as a Golden Globe award. Since, he has been criticized for his views on Pokemon cuteness disparity, claiming that 'All Pokemon are cute, but some are just cuter than others'. To back up this statement, he has traveled the Kanto region assessing every Pokemon’s cuteness based on his personal opinions. </p>

					<p>Nicolas Slocock earned his doctrate in Pokemon biology at and now teaches at an elite university in the unnova region, his research on the php (Pokemon Hibernation Process) of Pokemon has shined light on the world of seasonal variants of Pokemon. His most recognized accomplishment was the correlation he drew between the change of the earths season and the change of seasonal variants of Pokemon, implying that in winter, certain Pokemon would transform into their winter variant. However, other figures in the scientific community has critiqued this theory stating 'this claim is purely based on circumstantial evidence and we need to send more teenagers into uninhabited areas to conduct research'</p>
